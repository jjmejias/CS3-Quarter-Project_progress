		<p><h3>Plants are living creatures. They are found all around the globe, wether it is in land, harsh deserts, 
			underwater or, in deep caves. They get energy from the sun and produce oxygen through photosynthesis.
			It is because of plants that land-breathers today are able to breathe (Fun fact: It is estimated that 80%
			of the world's oxygen are produced by planktons). Furthurmore, Plants can also our food; the food that 
			are edible to us are called vegetables and fruits. We humans also use said food that are edible to us to
			restore our energy.</p></h3>

			<pclass="rext"><h3>The Guiana chestnut or otherwise known as "Money tree" is said to bring good luck and positive energy to the owner. 
			That is why the money tree has become a popular gift item for many occasions where the sentiment of luck is appropriate.
			Pachira aquatica is known by a large number of common names including water chestnut, Guiana chestnut and Malabar chestnut.
			In addition, it is often commercially sold as a houseplant or bonsai under the name of money tree or money plant. In the wild, 
			this is a tropical evergreen estuarine species that is native to freshwater swamps, estuaries and river banks in tropical rainforests 
			from Mexico to northern South America. It is cultivated in Hawaii and southern California. It is typically grown outdoors in frost-free 
			climates as a tropical ornamental and/or for harvest of its edible nuts. In cooler climates, it is often grown indoors as a foliage
			houseplant (rarely flowers) or bonsai, often in a braided trunk form. (Did you know? When a money tree has 7 leaves it is said to have
			extra good luck)</p><h3>

			<p class="rext"><h3>The banana is a gigantic herbaceous plant spread by rhizomes, and one of the most important food crops of the world. 
			The banana is consumed extensively throughout the tropics, where it is grown, and is also valued in the temperate zone for its flavour, 
			nutritional value, and constant availability. Hundreds of varieties are cultivated as a staple food source in tropical regions,
			though the Cavendish dessert banana is the variety most commonly imported by nontropical countries. The ripe fruit is high in carbohydrates 
			(mainly sugar), potassium, and vitamins C and A, and it is low in protein and fat. Though usually eaten fresh, bananas may also be cooked,
			fried or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings. They may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads.</p></h3>

			areas for its edible fruit, the coconut. Coconut palms are found in tropical coastal areas nearly worldwide and probably originated somewhere
			in Indo-Malaya. They are the most economically important palm species, coconuts being one of the predominant crops of the tropics. The slender,
			leaning, ringed trunk of the coconut palm rises to a height of up to 25 metres (80 feet) from a swollen base and is surmounted by a graceful 
			crown of giant featherlike leaves.Mature fruits, ovoid or ellipsoid in shape, have a thick fibrous husk surrounding the familiar single-seeded
			nut of commerce. A hard shell encloses the insignificant embryo with its abundant endosperm, composed of both meat and liquid. (Did you know? 
			The coconut palm is also called tree of life)</p></h3>
